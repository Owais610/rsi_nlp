## 🧼 Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Keyword-Based Filtering**: Custom include/exclude regex rules for each category to remove mislabeled posts.
- **Semantic Filtering** *(optional)*: Used Sentence Transformers for cosine similarity relevance scoring.
- **Tokenization**: Applied lowercasing, stopword removal, and encoding for model training.

### Load CSV (Pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("reddit_social_issues_cleaned.csv")
print(df.head())
```

### Load Tokenized JSON (for BERT-style input)
```python
import json

with open("preprocessed_reddit_social_issues_cleaned.json", "r") as f:
    data = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

print(data[0])
```

## 🔧 Potential Use Cases

- Training **text classification** models to identify infrastructure complaints
- Monitoring **public sentiment** and urgency around social issues
- Supporting **urban policy** and governance research
- Evaluating **NLP models** on real-world, multilingual or noisy text data
